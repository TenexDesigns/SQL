SQL aliasing is a technique used to give a table or a column in a table a temporary name within an SQL query. Aliasing can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. Simplifying column and table names: Aliases can be used to provide more suitable or shorter names for columns and tables, making the SQL query clearer and easier to understand.
2. JOIN operations: When working with JOIN operations involving multiple tables, aliases can be used to prefix column names and easily identify which table each column belongs to.
3. Aggregate functions: Aliases can be used to provide more meaningful names for the result of aggregate functions like COUNT() and SUM().

To use aliases in SQL queries, you can follow these guidelines:

1. To alias columns, use the AS keyword followed by the desired alias name after each column name in the SELECT statement. The AS keyword can be omitted if desired. For example:
   ```
   SELECT column_name AS alias_name
   FROM table_name;
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   SELECT customer_id AS id, customer_name AS name, age
   FROM customers
   WHERE age < 60;
   ```

2. To alias tables, provide an alias name after the table name using the AS keyword. This can be useful when working with multiple tables to make the SQL statement shorter. For example:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM Customers AS Persons;
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
   FROM Customers AS c
   JOIN Orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   WHERE c.customer_id = 4;
   ```

It's important to note that aliases are temporary and do not affect the actual table or column names in the database. Aliases can be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or special characters. Additionally, aliases are supported by most relational database management systems.
