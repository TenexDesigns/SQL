In SQL, the `CASE` statement is a powerful conditional expression that allows you to perform conditional logic within a query. It is often used to create calculated or derived columns based on specified conditions. The `CASE` statement has two formats: the simple `CASE` and the searched `CASE`.

Here's an explanation of both formats:

1. **Simple CASE Statement:**
   - The simple `CASE` statement compares an expression to a set of values and returns a result when a match is found.

   Syntax:
   ```sql
   CASE expression
       WHEN value1 THEN result1
       WHEN value2 THEN result2
       ...
       [ELSE resultN]
   END
   ```

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       employee_name,
       CASE department_id
           WHEN 1 THEN 'HR'
           WHEN 2 THEN 'Finance'
           WHEN 3 THEN 'IT'
           ELSE 'Other'
       END AS department_name
   FROM employees;
   ```

   In this example, the `CASE` statement assigns department names based on the `department_id` values.

2. **Searched CASE Statement:**
   - The searched `CASE` statement evaluates multiple conditions and returns a result when a condition is true.

   Syntax:
   ```sql
   CASE
       WHEN condition1 THEN result1
       WHEN condition2 THEN result2
       ...
       [ELSE resultN]
   END
   ```

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       product_name,
       CASE
           WHEN stock_quantity > 100 THEN 'In Stock'
           WHEN stock_quantity <= 100 AND stock_quantity > 0 THEN 'Low Stock'
           ELSE 'Out of Stock'
       END AS stock_status
   FROM products;
   ```

   In this example, the `CASE` statement evaluates the stock quantity and assigns a stock status based on the conditions.

3. **Using `CASE` in Aggregate Functions:**
   You can also use the `CASE` statement with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, or `AVG` to perform conditional aggregations. For example, you can calculate the total revenue for different products based on their categories.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       category_name,
       SUM(CASE WHEN price > 50 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS expensive_products_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN price <= 50 THEN price ELSE 0 END) AS total_revenue
   FROM products
   GROUP BY category_name;
   ```

   In this example, the `CASE` statements are used to calculate the count of expensive products and the total revenue for each category.

The `CASE` statement is a versatile tool in SQL, allowing you to add conditional logic to your queries, create custom columns, and perform more complex data transformations. It's widely used in reporting and data analysis to derive meaningful insights from data.
