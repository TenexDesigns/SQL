In the context of updating data in a database, you use the `UPDATE` statement, not the `ALTER` statement. These are two different SQL commands with distinct purposes:

1. **UPDATE Statement:**
   - The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing data within a table. You can change the values of specific columns in one or more rows based on specified conditions.
   - It is used for data manipulation and doesn't change the structure of the table. The primary goal of `UPDATE` is to update the content of the records in the table.
   - Example: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;`

2. **ALTER Statement:**
   - The `ALTER` statement is used to modify the structure of database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. It is not used for updating data within the table.
   - With `ALTER`, you can add or remove columns, change data types, add constraints, rename objects, and perform other changes that affect the schema of the database.
   - Example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name data_type;`

In summary, when you want to change the content of records within a table, you use the `UPDATE` statement. When you need to make structural changes to the database objects, such as modifying the table's schema, you use the `ALTER` statement. It's important to differentiate between these two SQL statements, as using the wrong one can lead to unexpected results or errors.
