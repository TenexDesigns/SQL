In SQL, temporary tables are special tables that are used to store and manipulate data temporarily during the execution of a query or a series of queries. They are typically used to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, or to store intermediate results for subsequent queries. Temporary tables are scoped to the session or connection in which they are created and are automatically dropped when the session ends.

There are two main types of temporary tables in SQL:

1. **Local Temporary Tables (`#tablename`):**
   - Local temporary tables are created with a single `#` sign as a prefix before the table name.
   - They are visible only to the current session in which they are created, and they are automatically dropped when the session ends.
   - Other sessions cannot access or reference local temporary tables.
   - Local temporary tables are often used within stored procedures or complex queries to store intermediate results.

   Example of creating and using a local temporary table:

   ```sql
   -- Create a local temporary table
   CREATE TABLE #TempTable (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50));

   -- Insert data into the temporary table
   INSERT INTO #TempTable VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Alice');

   -- Query the temporary table
   SELECT * FROM #TempTable;

   -- The temporary table is automatically dropped when the session ends.
   ```

2. **Global Temporary Tables (`##tablename`):**
   - Global temporary tables are created with a double `##` sign as a prefix before the table name.
   - They are visible to all sessions in the database and are automatically dropped when the last session that references them ends.
   - Global temporary tables are less common than local temporary tables and are used when multiple sessions need to share temporary data.

   Example of creating and using a global temporary table:

   ```sql
   -- Create a global temporary table
   CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50));

   -- Insert data into the temporary table
   INSERT INTO ##GlobalTempTable VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Alice');

   -- Query the temporary table from another session
   -- The global temporary table is dropped when the last session referencing it ends.
   ```

Key points to remember about temporary tables:

- Temporary tables are often used to simplify complex queries or to store intermediate results, which can improve query performance and readability.

- Data in temporary tables is local to the session for local temporary tables and shared among sessions for global temporary tables.

- Temporary tables are automatically dropped when the session or sessions referencing them end.

- It's important to use temporary tables judiciously, as creating too many of them can lead to increased memory usage and performance issues.

Temporary tables are a valuable feature in SQL for handling temporary data storage and are commonly used in various database applications, including data processing, reporting, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
