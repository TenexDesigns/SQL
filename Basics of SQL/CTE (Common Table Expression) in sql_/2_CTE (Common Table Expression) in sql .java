A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement in SQL. CTEs are useful for creating complex queries, improving query readability, and reusing subqueries within a query. Here are some key points about CTEs:

- CTEs are defined using the WITH keyword, followed by the CTE name and the query that defines the CTE.
- The CTE name is then used as a table-like reference within the subsequent query.
- CTEs can reference other CTEs, allowing for the creation of multi-level or recursive CTEs.
- CTEs are only visible within the query that defines them, making them suitable for complex queries that require intermediate results.
- CTEs can be used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements, depending on the requirements of the query.
- CTEs can be used to simplify and optimize queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
- CTEs can also improve query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan.

Here's an example of using a CTE to simplify a query:

```sql
WITH sales_data AS (
  SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY product
)
SELECT product, total_quantity
FROM sales_data
WHERE total_quantity > 100;
```

In this example, the CTE named "sales_data" calculates the total quantity of each product from the "orders" table. The subsequent query then references the CTE to filter the products with a total quantity greater than 100.

CTEs can be a powerful tool for organizing and simplifying complex SQL queries.
