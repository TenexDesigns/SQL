SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL uses various keywords and commands to perform tasks like creating, querying, updating, and managing data in a database. Here are some common SQL keywords and commands:

1. **SELECT:** Used to retrieve data from a database. You can specify columns, tables, and conditions to filter the data you want to retrieve.

2. **FROM:** Specifies the table from which to retrieve data in a SELECT statement.

3. **INSERT INTO:** Used to insert new records into a table.

4. **UPDATE:** Modifies existing records in a table.

5. **DELETE:** Removes records from a table.

6. **CREATE TABLE:** Creates a new table with specified columns and data types.

7. **ALTER TABLE:** Modifies an existing table, such as adding or dropping columns.

8. **DROP TABLE:** Deletes a table and all of its data.

9. **CREATE DATABASE:** Creates a new database.

10. **USE:** Selects a database to work with.

11. **WHERE:** Specifies conditions to filter data in a query.

12. **ORDER BY:** Sorts the result set by one or more columns.

13. **GROUP BY:** Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, typically used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.

14. **JOIN:** Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

15. **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN:** Different types of joins that control how records from the joined tables are included in the result set.

16. **HAVING:** Filters the result set after the GROUP BY clause has been applied.

17. **DISTINCT:** Removes duplicate rows from the result set.

18. **AS:** Renames a column or table in the result set, creating an alias.

19. **COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX:** Aggregate functions used to perform calculations on data in a column.

20. **AND, OR, NOT:** Logical operators for combining conditions in a WHERE clause.

21. **BETWEEN, LIKE, IN:** Operators used for pattern matching and specifying ranges or sets of values.

22. **CASE:** Conditional statement used in SELECT queries to perform different actions based on specified conditions.
