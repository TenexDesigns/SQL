In SQL, the operators `<`, `>`, `<>`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, and `IS NOT NULL` are used for various purposes when querying and manipulating data in a database. Additionally, wildcard characters can be used with the `LIKE` operator to perform pattern matching in text data. Here's an explanation of these operators and their usage:

1. **`<` and `>` Operators:**
   - `<` (less than) is used to check if a value is smaller than another value.
   - `>` (greater than) is used to check if a value is larger than another value.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 100;
   ```

2. **`<>` Operator:**
   - `<>` (not equal to) is used to check if a value is not equal to another value.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department <> 'HR';
   ```

3. **`LIKE` Operator:**
   - `LIKE` is used for pattern matching in text data. It allows the use of wildcard characters:
     - `%` (percent sign): Matches any sequence of characters (zero or more).
     - `_` (underscore): Matches any single character.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%'; -- Matches last names starting with 'S'.
   ```

4. **`IN` Operator:**
   - `IN` is used to specify a list of values to match in a column.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Books');
   ```

5. **`IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` Operators:**
   - `IS NULL` is used to check if a column contains a NULL value.
   - `IS NOT NULL` is used to check if a column does not contain a NULL value.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE ship_date IS NULL; -- Select orders with no ship date.
   ```

6. **Wildcard Characters with `LIKE`:**
   - You can use `%` and `_` as wildcard characters with the `LIKE` operator to perform more complex pattern matching.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE 'A%e'; -- Matches product names starting with 'A' and ending with 'e'.
   ```

These SQL operators and wildcards are essential for building flexible and precise queries in SQL, allowing you to filter, search, and manipulate data in various ways based on specific conditions and patterns.

In SQL, the characters <, >, <=, >=, LIKE, IN, NULL, NOT NULL, and wildcards serve various purposes for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. Here's a breakdown of their functions and usage:

**Comparison Operators:**

* **<:** Represents "less than". Compares two values and returns TRUE if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

* **>:** Represents "greater than". Compares two values and returns TRUE if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

* **<=:** Represents "less than or equal to". Compares two values and returns TRUE if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

* **>=:** Represents "greater than or equal to". Compares two values and returns TRUE if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.

**LIKE Operator:**

* **LIKE:** Used for pattern matching in character or string values. It allows you to search for data based on a specific pattern. For example, "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE '%Smith%'" returns all customers whose names contain the substring "Smith".

**IN Operator:**

* **IN:** Checks if a value matches any of a specified set of values. For instance, "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Toys')" returns all products belonging to the categories 'Electronics', 'Clothing', or 'Toys'.

**NULL Value:**

* **NULL:** Represents the absence of a value. It indicates that no data is present for a particular attribute.

**NOT NULL Constraint:**

* **NOT NULL:** Constrains a column to not accept NULL values. It ensures that every record in that column has a valid value.

**Wildcards:**

* **Wildcards:** Characters that represent one or more unknown characters. They are used for pattern matching in search queries.
    * **%:** Matches any sequence of characters, including zero characters.
    * **_:** Matches a single character.
    * **[]:** Matches a single character from the specified set of characters. For example, "[aeiou]" matches any vowel.

These operators and values play a crucial role in SQL queries, enabling you to filter, sort, and manipulate data effectively. By understanding their usage, you can construct complex and efficient SQL queries to retrieve the information you need from your database.
