In SQL, the `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter the results of a grouped query based on the results of aggregate functions. It allows you to specify conditions that must be met by the aggregated data, and it's typically used to filter grouped data to include or exclude groups that meet specific criteria.

Here's the basic syntax of the `HAVING` clause:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
HAVING condition;
```

The key points to remember about the `HAVING` clause are:

1. It comes after the `GROUP BY` clause.

2. It allows you to use aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) in the condition.

3. It is used to filter groups, not individual rows.

4. It works with the results of the aggregate functions and is applied to the grouped data.

Here's an example of how to use the `HAVING` clause in a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

In this example, we're selecting the average salary (`AVG(salary)`) for each department and then using the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to only include departments where the average salary is greater than $50,000.

The `HAVING` clause is particularly useful when you want to filter and aggregate data based on specific conditions. It allows you to control which groups are included in the result set and is commonly used in SQL for tasks such as data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence.
