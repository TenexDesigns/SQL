To delete data in SQL, you can use the DELETE statement. Here's how you can do it:

1. Specify the table from which you want to delete data using the DELETE FROM clause.
2. Use the WHERE clause to specify the condition for deleting specific rows. If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be deleted.

Here's the basic syntax for the DELETE statement:

```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Let's look at some examples to illustrate how to use the DELETE statement:

Example 1: Deleting a single row
```
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName = 'Alfreds Futterkiste';
```
This example deletes the row from the "Customers" table where the CustomerName is 'Alfreds Futterkiste'.

Example 2: Deleting multiple rows
```
DELETE FROM dependents
WHERE employee_id IN (100, 101, 102);
```
This example deletes the rows from the "dependents" table where the employee_id is 100, 101, or 102.

Example 3: Deleting all rows
```
DELETE FROM Customers;
```
This example deletes all rows from the "Customers" table. Be cautious when using this statement as it permanently removes all data from the table.

It's important to note that when you delete data using the DELETE statement, it cannot be undone. Therefore, it's recommended to take a backup of your data before performing any delete operations.
