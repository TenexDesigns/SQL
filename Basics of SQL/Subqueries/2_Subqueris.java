In SQL, a subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query that is embedded within another SQL query. Subqueries are used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on the result of an inner query. Subqueries can be placed within the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING clauses of an outer query, depending on the specific use case. Subqueries are a powerful tool in SQL for performing complex data retrieval and manipulation tasks.

Here are some common use cases for subqueries and examples:

1. **Subquery in the WHERE Clause:**
   - Subqueries in the WHERE clause are used to filter rows in the outer query based on a condition derived from the inner query.

   ```sql
   SELECT product_name
   FROM products
   WHERE category_id IN (SELECT category_id FROM categories WHERE category_name = 'Electronics');
   ```

   In this example, the subquery retrieves the category_id for 'Electronics,' and the outer query selects product names belonging to that category.

2. **Subquery in the SELECT Clause:**
   - Subqueries in the SELECT clause are used to calculate a single value or retrieve a single column that is displayed alongside each row in the result set.

   ```sql
   SELECT order_id, (SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price) FROM order_details WHERE order_id = orders.order_id) AS total_amount
   FROM orders;
   ```

   Here, the subquery calculates the total amount for each order, and the outer query lists order IDs alongside their corresponding total amounts.

3. **Subquery in the FROM Clause (Derived Tables):**
   - Subqueries in the FROM clause are often used to create derived tables that can be referenced just like regular tables in the outer query.

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(subquery.total_sales)
   FROM (SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_sales FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id) AS subquery;
   ```

   This example creates a derived table "subquery" that calculates the total sales for each customer, and the outer query calculates the average total sales.

4. **Correlated Subquery:**
   - A correlated subquery refers to the outer query's table within the subquery. It allows the subquery to reference data from the outer query.

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name
   FROM customers c
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id);
   ```

   In this correlated subquery, the inner query checks for the existence of orders for each customer in the outer query.

Subqueries provide a way to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and can be used for filtering, calculations, or data retrieval within SQL queries. They are a fundamental concept in SQL and are essential for performing advanced data analysis and manipulation.
