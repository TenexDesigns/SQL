A subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query that is embedded within another query in SQL. Subqueries are used to retrieve data from one or more tables and use that result set as a condition or value in the outer query. Here are some key points about subqueries:

- A subquery is enclosed within parentheses and can be placed in various parts of a SQL statement, such as the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING clauses.
- The result set of a subquery is used as a condition or value in the outer query.
- Subqueries can be used with comparison operators, such as =, >, <, IN, EXISTS, etc., to filter or join data.
- Subqueries can be correlated or non-correlated:
  - Non-correlated subqueries are independent of the outer query and can be executed on their own.
  - Correlated subqueries are dependent on the outer query and are executed for each row of the outer query.
- Subqueries can return a single value, a single row, or multiple rows, depending on the requirements of the query.
- Subqueries can be used to perform calculations, retrieve aggregated data, filter data based on conditions, or join multiple tables.

Here's an example of using a subquery to filter data:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
```

In this example, the subquery `(SELECT AVG(price) FROM products)` calculates the average price of all products. The outer query then retrieves the product name and price for products with a price greater than the average.

Subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to perform complex operations and retrieve data based on specific conditions or calculations.
