SQL UNION is a powerful operator that combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It is commonly used to merge data from different tables or to remove duplicate rows from a result set.

**Key Points about SQL UNION:**

1. **Union vs. Union All:** The UNION operator removes duplicate rows from the combined result set, while UNION ALL retains all rows, including duplicates.

2. **Compatible Columns:** The SELECT statements within a UNION operation must have the same number of columns, and the columns in each statement must have compatible data types.

3. **Ordering of Columns:** The order of columns in the result set is typically determined by the order of columns in the first SELECT statement.

4. **Subqueries:** UNION can be used with subqueries, allowing you to combine data from multiple levels of nested queries.

5. **Efficient Data Analysis:** UNION is an efficient way to combine data from different sources and perform comprehensive analysis across multiple tables.

**Examples of SQL UNION:**

1. **Combining Customer and Supplier Cities:**

```sql
SELECT City
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City
FROM Suppliers;
```

This query combines the cities from both the "Customers" and "Suppliers" tables, removing duplicate city names.

2. **Displaying Customer and Supplier Contact Information:**

```sql
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;
```

This query combines the contact information of customers and suppliers, adding a "Type" column to distinguish between them.

3. **Merging Data from Different Tables:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders
UNION
SELECT *
FROM OrderDetails;
```

This query combines all data from the "Orders" and "OrderDetails" tables, creating a single result set containing all order-related information.

SQL UNION is a versatile tool for manipulating and analyzing data in relational databases. Its ability to combine data from multiple sources and remove duplicates makes it an essential tool for data analysts and developers.
