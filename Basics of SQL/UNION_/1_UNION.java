The SQL UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It is particularly useful when you want to retrieve data from multiple tables and merge the results into a single result set. Here are some key points and examples of using the SQL UNION operator:

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

The key considerations for using UNION are as follows:
- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns.
- The columns must have similar data types.
- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order.

**UNION Example:**
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```

In this example, the query retrieves distinct city names from both the "Customers" and "Suppliers" tables and sorts them in alphabetical order. The UNION operator ensures that duplicate city names are eliminated, and only unique values are returned.

**SQL UNION ALL:**
The UNION operator, by default, returns distinct values. If you want to include duplicate values, you can use UNION ALL instead. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```

In this case, the result includes all city names from both tables, including duplicates.

**UNION with WHERE Clause:**
You can also use the UNION operator in combination with the WHERE clause to filter the results from both tables. Here's an example that retrieves distinct German cities from both "Customers" and "Suppliers" tables:

```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```

**UNION ALL with WHERE Clause:**
If you want to include duplicate German cities, you can use UNION ALL with the WHERE clause like this:

```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```

**Another UNION Example:**
You can also use UNION to combine data from two tables while introducing a temporary column alias. In this example, it lists all customers and suppliers with an additional "Type" column to differentiate between them:

```sql
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;
```

This example introduces the "AS Type" alias to create a temporary column named "Type" that indicates whether the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier."

The SQL UNION operator is a powerful tool for combining and manipulating data from multiple tables, allowing you to create more complex queries and obtain the desired results.
